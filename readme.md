## Project Overview
This is the Readme file that explains the differents deliveries and their executions.

## Features
1. **Interactive Dashboards**  
   - The Tableau folder containg the dataset and the Gold_VT.twb Tableau file. 

2. **Predictive Model**  
   - The predictive model stated in the template is stored in the NOTEBOOKS folder. In that folder we have:
        - a Data cleaning notebook that prepares the dataset. 
        - the Predictive model that predics gold prices and creates the model .pkl file for the srteamlit app.
        - and extra notebook used for a part of the streamlit app (referenced in the streamlit app aswell).
    there is no need to execute the notebooks to run the streamlit as the necessary dataset are already created, but if it is needed, they can be executed.
    
3. **Streamlit app**
   - The streamlit_app folder contains the main page for executing, goldytics.py, and a pages folder containing the rest of pages of the app.
   - To execute the app you must open an integrated terminal in streamlit_app folder and type 'streamlit run goldytics.py'

4. **Comprehensive Report**  
   - A detailed report summarizing key findings, methodologies, and insights named Report.pdf.
